# Why custom layouts matter for the average working typer

Most humans work with their hands all day, some with keyboards, more than eight hours a day.

The [average office employee][typing.com] types F
over 4.3 million words in a year and still thinks that they do not work with their hands. In my opinion this is a problem. Let us turn this around and this thought does not make sense anymore, imagine telling
a chef that they do not work with their brain because they are using their hands to prepare food, only when they think
about the menu they actually work with their brain. Why should you feel that you do not work with your hands when you type all day. I understand that this it is not the same feeling to type and to knit,
but the mindset should be the same, you would not knit the most annoying way you could, especially not at work. You would also not
want your hands to hurt or injure them. You choose the right tools and even adjust the tools to make live easier or just better, why not better keyboards?

As an addition to "why it matters" I recommend reading [this article][blog].

# My keyboard and layout

I use a [zsa moonlander][zsa-moon], this sounds like a thing in a game or a science fiction movie but is just a keyboard with thumb keys.

## Keyboard
![my keyboard](https://github.com/SilenLoc/My_KeyBoard/blob/d3efc5f2063fa8317d96ecca00af5abefffb3a6b/visual/keyboard.jpeg?raw=true)
> you can change or turn off the lights

## Layout
![my layout](https://github.com/SilenLoc/My_KeyBoard/blob/5b14b336018119767ba61a7364ebafe440c54795/visual/layout.png?raw=true)
> this looks complicated, but it is not, I promise

The [zsa moonlander][zsa-moon] is a great keyboard to start with, but the [zsa voyager][zsa-voy] came out last year and provided a keyboard that works for everyone. I did not test that one, but I think it is better for general typing tasks.
If you want to have a keyboard that fits everywhere and is not so sturdy you might like the [zsa voyager][zsa-voy] more than the [zsa moonlander][zsa-moon].
My specific layout is only working with the [zsa moonlander][zsa-moon], but you can use the base layout I use [colmak dh][colmak]
for any keyboard. Those two keyboards have "layers" which you can switch into and out of with a key you decide where it is.
Most keyboards have static key positions, this means you can not change the symbol that is getting typed when pressing the physical key.
The only way out of this, is to use scripts that change the input the computer is getting of the keyboard on the computer itself, or the keyboards are somewhat scriptable themselves.
The keyboards of zsa have their layout compiled into the keyboard itself (you do not need to write scripts for that), this means you can change the layout and take the layout with the keyboard with you.They also provide a lot of easy to use tools around it.
This might sound ridiculous, but you will find that after some practice you will be faster than on your old layout.
I even got faster on qwerty after using my very different layout. The even crazier sounding idea I have for you is, when getting your keyboard, do use blank key caps.
This may seem harder, but believe me it will be fine. There are great tools to [train][zsa-train] the custom layout and keyboard by the company that made them. You might just also be okay with non-blank key caps, but I really recommend using a different layout than qwerty. 

# To summarize and complete

- do not think that you do not work with your hands because you are "only" typing 
- getting better at typing and improving your work gear can bring you a lot of joy, efficiency, less pain and more finger strength
- choose a custom layout. Qwerty or any other typewriter layout was not designed for today's use of keyboards, you will get some advice here: [general][adv], [colmak dh][colmak], [getruer][blog]
- layout matters, practice matters more, you can practice with a zsa product [here][zsa-train], with any other [here][typefast] or [here][monkey]
- get a keyboard where you can take your custom layout with you, for typers that work in an office with or without laptops I recommend the [voyager][zsa-voy]
- do not overthink the choosing of a layout, many are only there because qwerty and others are so bad.
- be careful with country specific keys, for zsa products you need to configure the swiss keys and not the default ones.
- have fun typing :)
