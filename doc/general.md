# Why custom layouts matter for any typing human

Most humans work with their hands all day, some with keyboards, more than eight hours a day.

The [average office employee][typing.com] types
over 4.3 million words in a year, often overlooking the tactile nature of their work. I find this perception to be a significant concern.
While I acknowledge the distinction between typing and activities like knitting, the underlying mindset should be analogous.    
Just as one wouldn't adopt the most cumbersome knitting technique, especially in a professional setting, the same consideration should extend to typing.
The shared principle is prioritizing comfort and efficiency.
Just as you wouldn't want your hands to ache or sustain injuries while knitting, the same holds true for typing at work.
Choosing the right tools is paramount in both scenarios.
In knitting, you'd select appropriate needles and techniques for a smoother experience. Similarly, why not invest in better keyboards and layouts to enhance the ease and quality of our daily work?

As an addition to "why it matters" I recommend reading [this article][blog].

# My keyboard and layout

I use a [zsa moonlander][zsa-moon], this sounds like a thing in a game or a science fiction movie but is just a keyboard with thumb keys.

## Keyboard

> you can change or turn off the lights

## Layout

> this looks complicated, but it is not, I promise

The [ZSA Moonlander][zsa-moon] serves as an excellent entry-level keyboard, yet the [ZSA Voyager][zsa-voy], introduced last year, offers a universal solution catering to a broader audience, particularly for general typing tasks.
While I haven't personally tested the Voyager, I believe it excels in versatility.
If you prefer a keyboard that's adaptable to various environments and doesn't prioritize robustness, the [ZSA Voyager][zsa-voy] may be more suitable than the [ZSA Moonlander][zsa-moon].
My personal layout is exclusive to the Moonlander, but I've configured a base layout, [Colemak DH][colmak], applicable to any keyboard.
Both ZSA keyboards feature customizable layers, allowing you to seamlessly switch between different key configurations at the touch of a designated key.
In contrast to conventional keyboards with fixed key positions, the ZSA keyboards embed their layouts directly, eliminating the need for external scripts.
This feature enables you to modify the layout and carry it with you, complemented by user-friendly tools provided by ZSA.
Although it may initially seem unconventional, with practice, you'll likely find increased typing speed compared to traditional layouts.
For a more adventurous approach, consider opting for blank key caps.
While this might seem challenging, the learning curve is manageable, supported by effective training tools offered by ZSA.
While non-blank key caps are also an option, I strongly advocate for exploring a different layout than QWERTY for an optimized typing experience.



# To summarize and complete

- Don't dismiss the significance of working with your hands just because you're "only" typing.
- Enhancing your typing skills and upgrading your work gear can bring immense joy, boost efficiency, alleviate discomfort, and enhance finger strength.
- Consider adopting a custom keyboard layout. Traditional layouts like QWERTY weren't designed for today's keyboard use. Explore options such as [General][adv], [Colemak DH][colmak], or [Getruer][blog] for guidance.
- While layout is important, consistent practice is even more crucial. Utilize ZSA's training tools [here][zsa-train], or with any product try [here][typefast] or [here][monkey].
- Opt for a keyboard that allows you to carry your custom layout with you. For general typists, especially those with or without laptops, the [Voyager][zsa-voy] is a recommended choice.
- Don't overanalyze the choice of a layout; many alternatives exist because traditional layouts like QWERTY have limitations.
- When configuring ZSA products, ensure configuration aligns with your countries layout rather than default ones.
- Enjoy the typing journey! :)
